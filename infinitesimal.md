# Fourier Series:

<u>Jean Baptiste Fourier (1768â€“1830)</u> proved the mathematical fact that any periodic waveform can be expressed as the sum of an infinite set of sine waves. 

The frequency of a wave is obtained by including a factor of time in the mix.

### Types of  waves:

Longitudinal vs Transverse vs Surface waves

```C
Sound == Longitudinal wave
```

# The infinite and the infinitesimal #

The central task of composition has always been the management of the interaction amongst structures on different time scales.

### Nine-time scales of music, starting from the longest:

**1- infinite:** the ideal span of mathematical durations such as the infinite sine waves of classical Fourier analysis.
**2- Supra:** A time scale beyond that of an individual composition and extending into months, years, decades, and centuries.
**3- Macro:** The time scale of overall musical architecture or form, measured in minutes or hours, or in extreme cases, days.
**4- Meso:** Divisions of form. Grouping of sound objects into hierarchies of phrase structures of various sizes, measured in minutes or seconds.
**5- Sound Object:** A basic unit of musical structure, generalizing the traditional concept of note to include complex and mutating sound events on a time scale ranging from a fraction of a second to several seconds.
**6- Micro:** Sound particles on a time scale that extends down to the threshold of auditory perception (measured in thousandths of a second or milliseconds)
**7- Sample:** The atomic level of digital audio systems: individual binary samples or numerical amplitude values, one following another at a fixed time interval. The period between samples is measured in millionths of a second (microseconds).
**8- Subsample:** Fluctuations on a time scale too brief to be properly recorded or perceived, measured in billionths of a second (nanoseconds) or less.
**9- Infinitesimal:** The ideal time span of mathematical durations such as the infinitely brief delta functions.

The nature of elements according to Euclid.

For that which is the means of obtaining is an element of that which is obtained.

reductio ad absurdum

It is essential that such a treatise should be rid of everything superfluous (for this is an obstacle to the acquisition of knowledge); it should be everything that embraces the subject and brings it to a point (for this is the supreme service to science).

The term element is applied by analogy to that which, being one and small, is useful for many purposes.

For every demonstrative science has to do with three things:
1) The things which are assumed to exist, namely the genus (subject-matter) in each case, the essential properties of which the science investigates.
2) The common axioms so-called, which are the primary source of demonstration, and
3) the properties with regard to which all that is assumed is the meaning of the respective terms used.
