# The Elements : Euclid

An extract of the introduction from the 1908 Edition.

### : ON THE NATURE OF ELEMENTS

* For that which is the means of obtaining is an element of that which is obtained. 

* From this elements, we shall be able to acquire knowledge of the other parts of this science as well, while without them it is impossible for us to get a grasp of so complext a subject, and knowledge of the rest is unattainable.

* For every demonstrative science has to do with three things, (1) the things which are assumed to exist, namely the genus (subject-matter) in each case, the essential properties of which the science investigates, (2) the common axioms so-called, which are the primary source of demonstration, and (3) the properties with regard to which all that is assumed is the meaning of the respective terms used.

* One of two contradictories must be true, and it is impossible for the same thing to be and not be.

* It is impossible that there should be demonstration of everything.

* The first condition of the possibility of any argument whatever is that words should signify something both to the speaker and to the hearer.

  

#### : Other Technical Terms:

1. **Things said to be given:**

   "Everything that is given is given in one or other of the following ways, in position, in ratio, in magnitude, or in species.".

* **Given in position:** "Points, lines and angles are said to be given in position which always occupy the same place."
* **Given in magnitude:** "Areas lines and angles are called given in magnitude to which we can find equals."
* **Given in species:** Rectilineal figures are said to be iven in species in which the angles are severally given and the ratios of the sides to one another are given.
* **Given in ratio:** presumably means something which is given by means of its ratio to some other given thing.

2. **Lemma:**

   The term lemma is often used of any proposition which is assumed for the construction of something else.

   The special meaning of lemma in geometry is a proposition requiring confirmation.

   Because we regard what has been assumed as doubtful in itself and therefore worthy of investigation, we call it a lemma. Now in the discovering of lemmas the best aid is a mental aptitude for it.

   Certain ethods have been handed down. The finest is the method which by means of analysis carries the thing sought up to an acknowledged principle, a method which Plato, as they say, communicated to Leodamas, and by which the latter, too, is said to have discovered many things in geometry. The second is the method of division which divides into its parts the genus proposed for consideration an gives a starting-point for the demonstration by means of elimination of the other elements in the construction of what is proposed, which method also Plato extolled as being of assistance to all sciences. The third is that  by means of the reductio and absurdum, which does not show what is sought directly, but refutes its opposite and discovers the truth incidentally.

3. **Case:** Announces different ways of construction and alteration of positions due to the transposition of points or lines or planes or solids. And, in general, all its varieties are seen in the figure, and this is why it is called case, being a transposition in the construction.

4. **Porism:** Specially used when from what has been demonstrated some other theorem as on this very account been called a porism (corollary) as being a sort of incidental gain arising from the scientific demonstration.

5. **Objection:** Obstructs the whole course of the argument by appearing as an obstacle either to the construction or to the demonstration.

   The objection endeavours to make it appear that the demonstration is not true in every case; and it is then necessary to prove, in refutation of the objection, either that the supposed case is impossible, or that the demonstration is true even for that case.

   "An objection is a proposition contrary to a proposition, objections are of two sorts, general or partial."

6. **Reductio:** It is the transition from one problem or theorem to another, the solution or proof which makes that which is propounded manifest also

7. **Reductio ad absurdum:** "proof per impossible". All which reach the conclusion per impossible reason out a conclusion which is false, and they prove the original contention from hypothesis, when something impossible results from assuming the contradictory of the original contention.

   Proofs by reductio ad absurdum in every case reach a conclusion manifestly impossible, a conclusion the contradictory of which is admitted. Every reductio ad absurdum assumes what conflicts with the desired result, then, using that as a basis, proceeds until it arrives at an admitted absurdity, by thus destroying the hypothesis, establishes the result originally desired. For it is necessary to understand generally that all mathematical arguments either proceed from the first principles or lead back to them.

   It is the function of this method to upset something admitted as clear.

8. **Analysis and Synthesis:** 

   * Analysis is an assumption of that which is sought as if it were admitted < and the passage > through its consequences to something admitted (to be) true.
   * Synthesis is an assumption of that which is admitted < and the passage > through its consequences to the finishing or attainment of what is sought.
