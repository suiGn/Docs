### Axiom 1:

**Static**.

Definition: no mass, no motion, no wavelength, no location in space or in time. 

Ability to **postulate and perceive.**

```js
var int static;
```

### Axiom 2:

The Static is capable of considerations, postulates, and opinions.

```js
var static = 0;
function static(perceive){
var considerations;
var postulates:
var opinion;

}
```

**Axiom 3:**

Space, energy, objects, form and time are the result of considerations made and/or agreed upon or not by the Static, and are perceived solely because the Static considers that it can perceive them.

```js
var static = 0;
function static(perceive){
var considerations = [space: 0, energy: 0, objects: 0, form: 0, time: 0]:;
var postulates:
var opinion:
return outcome;
}
```

### Axiom 4:

Space is a **viewpoint of dimension.**

```js
var static = 0;
var space = x + y + z;
function static(perceive){
var considerations = [space: , 
                      energy: x,y,z, 
                      objects: 0, 
                      form: 0, 
                      time: 0]:;
var postulates:
var opinion:
return postulate;
}
```

#### Axiom 5:

Energy consists of postulated particles in space.

```js
var static = 0;
var space = x + y + z;
var energy = [particle[.]: x + y + z];

var perceive = [space: space, 
  					energy: energy]; 

function static(perceive){
var considerations = [space: floating, energy: 0, objects: 0, form: 0, time: 0]:;
var postulates(space, energy,){
  
}
]
var opinion:
return postulate;
}
```

#### Axiom 6:

Objects consist of grouped particles and also of solid masses.

```js
var static = 0;
var space = x + y + z;
var energy = [particle: x + y + z];
var objects = particles; //grouped particles; At certain pixel.

var perceive = [space: space, 
  					energy: energy]; 

function static(perceive){
var considerations = [space: floating, energy: 0, objects: 0, form: 0, time: 0]:;
var postulates(space, energy,){

}
]
var opinion:
return postulate;
}
```

Axiom 7:

Time is basically a postulate that space and particles will persist.

Axiom 8:

The apparency of time is the change of position of particles in space.

Axiom 9:

Change is the primary manifestation of time.

Axiom 10:

The highest purpose in this Universe is the creation of an effect.

Axiom 11:

The considerations resulting in conditions of existence are fourfold:

a. As-isness is the condition of immediate creation without persistence, and is the condition of existence which exists at the moment of creation and the moment of destruction, and is different from other considerations in that it does not contain survival.

b. Alter-isness is the consideration which introduces change, and therefore time and persistence, into an As-isness to obtain persistency.

c. Isness is an apparency of existence brought about by the continuous alteration of an As-isness. This is called, when agreed upon, Reality.

d. Not-isness is the effort to handle Isness by reducing its condition through the use of force. It is an apparency and cannot entirely vanquish an Isness.

Axiom 12:

The primary condition of any universe is that two spaces, energies or objects must not occupy the same space. When this condition is violated (perfect duplicate) the apparency of any universe or any part thereof is nulled.

Axiom 13:

The Cycle-of-Action of the physical universe is: Creation, Survival, Destruction.

Axiom 14:

Survival is accomplished by Alter-isness and Not-isness, by which is gained the persistency known as time.

Axiom 15:

Creation is accomplished by the postulation of an As-isness.

Axiom 16:

Complete destruction is accomplished by the postulation of the As-isness of any existence and the parts thereof.

Axiom 17:

The Static, having postulated As-isness, then practices Alter-isness, and so achieves the apparency of Isness and so obtains Reality.

Axiom 18:

The Static, in practicing Not-isness, brings about the persistence of unwanted existences, and so brings about unreality, which includes forgetfulness, unconsciousness and other undesirable states.

Axiom 19:

Bringing the Static to view As-is any condition devaluates that condition.

Axiom 20:

Bringing the Static to create a perfect duplicate causes the vanishment of any existence or part thereof.

A perfect duplicate is an additional creation of the object, its energy and space, in its own space, in its own time, using its own energy. This violates the condition that two objects must not occupy the same space, and causes vanishment of the object.

Axiom 21:

Understanding is composed of Affinity, Reality and Communication.

Axiom 22:

The practice of Not-isness reduces Understanding.

Axiom 23:

The Static has the capability of total Knowingness. Total Knowingness would consist of total ARC.

Axiom 24:

Total ARC would bring about the vanishment of all mechanical conditions of existence.

Axiom 25:

Affinity is a scale of attitude which falls away from the co-existence of Static, through the interpositions of distance and energy, to create identity, down to close proximity but mystery.

By the practice of Isness (Beingness) and Not-isness (refusal to Be) individuation progresses from the Knowingness of complete identification down through the introduction of more and more distance and less and less duplication, through Lookingness, Emotingness, Effortingness, Thinkingness, Symbolizingness, Eatingness, Sexingness, and so through to Not-Knowingness (Mystery). Until the point of Mystery is reached, some communication is possible, but even at Mystery an attempt to communicate continues. Here we have, in the case of an individual, a gradual falling-away from the belief that one can assume a complete Affinity down to the conviction that all is a complete Mystery. Any individual is somewhere on this Know to Mystery Scale. The original Chart of Human Evaluation was the Emotion section of this scale.

Axiom 26:

Reality is the agreed-upon apparency of existence.

Axiom 27:

An Actuality can exist for one individually, but when it is agreed with by others it can then be said to be a Reality.

The anatomy of Reality is contained in Isness, which is composed of As-isness and Alter-isness. Isness is an apparency, it is not an Actuality. The Actuality is As-isness altered so as to obtain a persistency.

Unreality is the consequence and apparency of the practice of Not-isness.

Axiom 28:

Communication is the consideration and action of impelling an impulse or particle from source-point across a distance to receipt-point, with the intention of bringing into being at the receipt-point a duplication and understanding of that which emanated from the source-point.

The Formula of Communication is: Cause, Distance, Effect, with Intention, Attention and Duplication with Understanding.

The component parts of Communication are Consideration, Intention, Attention, Cause, Source-point, Distance, Effect, Receipt-point, Duplication, Understanding, the Velocity of the impulse or particle, Nothingness or Somethingness. A non-Communication consists of Barriers. Barriers consist of Space, Interpositions (such as walls and screens of fast-moving particles) and Time. A communication, by definition, does not need to be two-way. When a communication is returned, the Formula is repeated, with the Receipt-point now becoming a Source-point and the former Source-point now becoming a Receipt-point.

Axiom 29:

In order to cause an As-isness to persist, one must assign other authorship to the creation than his own. Otherwise, his view of it would cause its vanishment.

Any space, energy, form, object, individual or physical universe condition can exist only when an alteration has occurred of the original As-isness so as to prevent a casual view from vanishing it. In other words, anything which is persisting must contain a “lie” so that the original consideration is not completely duplicated.

Axiom 30:

The general rule of auditing is that anything which is unwanted and yet persists must be thoroughly viewed, at which time it will vanish.

If only partially viewed, its intensity, at least, will decrease.

Axiom 31:

Goodness and Badness, Beautifulness and Ugliness, are alike considerations and have no other basis than opinion.

Axiom 32:

Anything which is not directly observed tends to persist.

Axiom 33:

Any As-isness which is altered by Not-isness (by force) tends to persist.

Axiom 34:

Any Isness, when altered by force, tends to persist.

Axiom 35:

The Ultimate Truth is a Static.

A Static has no mass, meaning, mobility, no wavelength, no time, no location in space, no space.

This has the technical name of “Basic Truth.”

Axiom 36:

A lie is a second postulate, statement or condition designed to mask a primary postulate which is permitted to remain.

Examples::

Neither truth nor a lie is a motion or alteration of a particle from one position to another.

A lie is a statement that a particle having moved did not move, or a statement that a particle not having moved did move.

The basic lie is that a consideration which was made was not made, or that it was different.

Axiom 37:

When a primary consideration is altered but still exists, persistence is achieved for the altering consideration.

All persistence depends on the Basic Truth, but the persistence is of the altering consideration, for the Basic Truth has neither persistence nor impersistence.

Axiom 38:

1: Stupidity is the unknownness of consideration.

2: Mechanical Definition: Stupidity is the unknownness of time, place, form and event.

1: Truth is the exact consideration.

2: Truth is the exact time, place, form and event.

Thus we see that failure to discover Truth brings about stupidity.

Thus we see that the discovery of Truth would bring about an As-isness by actual experiment.

Thus we see that an Ultimate Truth would have no time, place, form or event.

Thus, then, we perceive that we can achieve a persistence only when we mask a truth.

Lying is an alteration of time, place, event or form.

Lying becomes Alter-isness, becomes stupidity.

(The blackness of cases is an accumulation of the case’s own or another’s lies.)

Anything which persists must avoid As-isness. Thus, anything to persist must contain a lie.

Axiom 39:

Life poses problems for its own solution.

Axiom 40:

Any problem, to be a problem, must contain a lie. If it were truth, it would unmock.

An “unsolvable problem” would have the greatest persistence. It would also contain the greatest number of altered facts.

To make a problem, one must introduce Alter-isness.

Axiom 41:

That into which Alter-isness is introduced becomes a problem.

Axiom 42:

Mest (Matter, Energy, Space, Time) persists because it is a problem.

It is a problem because it contains Alter-isness.

Axiom 43:

Time is the primary source of untruth.

Time states the untruth of consecutive considerations.

Axiom 44:

Theta (the Static) has no location in Matter, Energy, Space or Time. It is capable of consideration.

Axiom 45:

Theta can consider itself to be placed, at which moment it becomes placed, and to that degree a problem.

Axiom 46:

Theta can become a problem by its considerations but then becomes Mest.

A problem is to some degree Mest. Mest is a problem.

Axiom 47:

Theta can resolve problems.

Axiom 48:

Life is a game wherein Theta as the Static solves the problems of Theta as Mest.

Axiom 49:

To solve any problem it is only necessary to become theta the solver rather than theta the problem.

Axiom 50:

Theta as Mest must contain considerations which are lies.

Axiom 51:

Postulates and live communication not being Mest and being senior to Mest can accomplish change in Mest without bringing about a persistence of Mest. Thus auditing can occur.

Axiom 52:

Mest persists and solidifies to the degree that it is not granted life.

Axiom 53:

A Stable Datum is necessary to the alignment of data.

Axiom 54:

A tolerance of confusion and an agreed-upon Stable Datum on which to align the data in a confusion are at once necessary for a sane reaction on the eight dynamics. This defines sanity.

Axiom 55:

The Cycle-of-Action is a consideration. Create, Survive, Destroy, the Cycle-of-Action accepted by the GE, is only a consideration which can be changed by the thetan making a new consideration or different action cycles.

Axiom 56:

Theta brings order to chaos.

Corollary: Chaos brings disorder to theta.

Axiom 57:

Order manifests when Communication, Control and Havingness are available to theta.

Definitions:

Communication: The interchange of ideas across space.

Control: Positive postulating, which is intention, and the execution thereof.

Havingness: That which permits the experience of mass and pressure.

Axiom 58:

Intelligence and judgment are measured by the ability to evaluate relative importances.

Corollary: The ability to evaluate importances and unimportances is the highest faculty of logic.

Corollary: Identification is a monotone assignment of importance.

Corollary: Identification is the inability to evaluate differences in time, location, form, composition or importance.

The above is a summary of states of being which can be used to create, cause to persist or destroy.

HAVING AGREED TO THE MECHANICS AND RETAINING THE AGREEMENTS, THE THETAN CAN YET MAKE INNUMERABLE POSTULATES WHICH, BY THEIR CONTRADICTION AND COMPLEXITY, CREATE, CAUSE TO PERSIST AND DESTROY HUMAN BEHAVIOR.
